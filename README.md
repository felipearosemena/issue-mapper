#Issue Mapper

CLI tool for mapping issues across third party platforms.

Whether you call them issues (in the case of git), cards (in the case of Trello)) they all
share a similar purpose: *To keep track of progress for a particular feature that needs to be worked on*

They also share multiple common features:

- An issue can have a `title` & `description`
- An issue can have any number of `attachments`
- Most importantly, and issue hosts a discussion thread or `comments`
- Additionally issues can have `labels`, `assignees`, `dues date` & many other platform specific features

The purpose of this tools is to create a uniform layer for mapping from input to output
